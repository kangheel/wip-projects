It was a hot summer day in June. My brother and dad decided to go outside, and I felt left out. Hoping to play with them, I decided to tag along. As soon as we went outside, Jaden and dad played soccer, basketball, badminton, and tag. I, being the annoying younger sibling, followed them around like a duckling attached to its mom. However, I wasn't able to do the activities my brother and dad were doing yet, so I felt bored. Then they started debating on which activity they should do next. After a while, they finally decided on doing something useful, riding a bike. While they rode fast, I rode on my pink Hello Kitty tricycle. At first, my little legs didn't move the way I wanted them to. For a while, I tried to push the pedals as hard as I can, and it seemed like I was going really fast. However, seeing my brother and my dad go past me, I quickly realized I was nowhere as fast as they were. It looked as if they were going 50 mph so effortlessly! Eventually, I caught up with them. Even though my legs were very sore, I felt accomplished that I didn't need to ask them to slow down. Suddenly, I remembered that there was one more bike that no one used. It was like the bike and I was meant to be. "Dad! I give up riding the tricycle. It's about time I learn how to use a big, two-wheeled bike!" I yelled. After hours of practice, I was finally able to ride my bike on my own! I no longer cried when I fell down or needed any help. I was smiling until my cheeks hurt, but that didn't matter. What mattered was that a few hours ago, I was riding on a tricycle. As a result of practicing, I was racing and catching up with my brother and dad without having my legs sore. I almost wished I would've learned how to ride a big bike earlier, but I'm glad I didn't because all of the memories would've been different.
